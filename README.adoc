= Crux SQL Demo

This is a demo project showcasing Crux SQL integration, as can be
found in the https://youtu.be/HEBL_ue2wbw[video].

To play with the example code, start up a REPL against the `deps.edn`
and `in-ns` to `juxt.sql-demo`. From there, run a system using
`(reset)`, and execute the relevant source blocks with-in the
namespace.

More instructions on how to configure Crux to use SQL are on the
https://github.com/juxt/crux/blob/master/crux-sql/README.adoc[module
readme].

We hope you find this demo source code useful!
